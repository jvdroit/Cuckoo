What is Cuckoo Sandbox?

Cuckoo Sandbox is a malware analysis system.
If you want to analyze malware, you might have run in to the Cuckoo Sandbox project which has been crafted by Claudio Guarnieri , Alessandro Tanasi , Jurriaan Bremer and Mark Schloesser.

The team which has been mentioned earlier has created the Cuckoo Sandbox project, so people will be able to analyze malware in their own personal environment.

So what does the Cuckoo Sandbox project produce as results?

The Cuckoo Sandbox is able to provide RAW data which includes, but is not limited to:

–          Native functions and Windows API calls traces

–          Copies of files created and deleted from the filesystem

–          Dump of the memory of the selected process

–          Full memory dump of the analysis machine

–          Screenshots of the desktop during the execution of the malware analysis

–          Network dump generated by the machine used for the analysis

Once the RAW data has been collected, the Cuckoo Sandbox project will allow the user to create “end-user” reports. The Cuckoo Sandbox is currently able to provide the following types of reports:

–          JSON

–          HTML

–          MAEC

–          MongoDB interface

–          HPFeeds interface

The Cuckoo Sandbox has been written in Python, so you can easily access the source code and adjust it to your personal demands.



What does that mean?

It means that you can throw any suspicious file at it and get a report with details about the file's behavior inside an isolated environment.

Supported systems

Most of this script is not distro dependant (tough of course you've got to run it on GNU/Linux), but package installation, at this moment supports only debian derivatives.

Also, given that we use the propietary virtualbox version (most of the time OSE edition doesn't fulfill our needs), this script requires that they've got a debian repo in Virtualbox Downloads for your distro. Forcing the distro in config file should make it work in unsupported ones.
